This repository contains a Software Development Kit (SDK) for creating augmented reality (AR) experiences for the AR Magic Lantern (ARML), a novel AR device that has the form-factor of a flashlight and projects AR content onto physical surfaces around the user. 

### Who is it for?

This SDK is intended for use by a wide range of users, including educators, researchers, independent game developers, content producers, and creative professionals. While it is meant to accommodate users of many different levels of technical expertise, it assumes a basic understanding of the Unity game engine.

### Requirements

In order to create and edit applications for the ARML using the SDK, you will need:
-	A computer that can run Unity (Windows, Mac or Linux)
-	An installation of Unity version 2022.3.8 or higher

In order to run and test applications, you will need to obtain an ARML-1 hardware developer kit. Please contact us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/zWZT3yKf4q) for more information about ARML hardware.

### Installation

The SDK is released as a 2022.3.8 Unity project that can be used as a template for other projects. To get started, download the [Unity project](https://github.com/fubilab/arml-sdk/releases/download/pre-release/unity-arml-sdk-v0.1.0.zip) from the latest release and open it in Unity. Then it is recommended to follow the walkthroughs for the [WallGame](https://fubilab.github.io/arml-sdk/SDK/examples/WallGame) and [GarumGame](https://fubilab.github.io/arml-sdk/SDK/examples/GarumGame) sample scenes in the [SDK Docs](https://fubilab.github.io/arml-sdk/SDK/).
