The SDK has a some global parameters that you can change to configure the application runtime. 

## Game scene
_Logic Scene -> Controllers -> Game Controllers_  
These properties control the scene that loads when the application is run on the ARML. There are some other parameters that control the game startup, including:
-	__Load on start__: Checked by default. Developers may uncheck this to debug the runtime of the SDK without loading a game scene.
-	__Fade to Black settings__: These change the transition effect for starting the game.

## Voice Control settings
_Logic Scene -> Lantern -> Lantern Canvas -> STT Mic_  
These properties activate or deactivate voice control in the application.

## Visual style settings
_Logic Scene -> Lantern -> Lantern Canvas_  
The “Vignette” and “Crosshair” objects have properties that allow the user to change the visual styles of the vignette and crosshair graphics used in the ARML projections.
