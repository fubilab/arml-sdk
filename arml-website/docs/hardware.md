In addition to a powerful, 600 ANSI lumen projector, the ARML contains a camera/IMU module, a mainboard with a powerful processor and GPU, stereo speakers, a microphone, and an embedded cooling system. It is powered by a rechargeable, swappable lithium-ion battery that allows 90 minutes to 2 hours of play time, depending on the system load. The system also integrates an Arduino-compatible microcontroller for marshalling input from a button on the device's handle and controlling an LED array mounted in the front of the ARML.
