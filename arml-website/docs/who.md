This SDK is intended for use by a wide range of users, including educators, researchers, independent game developers, content producers, and creative professionals. While it is meant to accommodate users of many different levels of technical expertise, it assumes a basic understanding of the Unity game engine. In addition, the method of loading applications onto the ARML device (covered in a subsequent section) involves copying files between computers using physical media or the network, so in that sense the SDK requires basic experience managing files in the Ubuntu desktop environment.
